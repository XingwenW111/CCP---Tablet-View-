                As a design student, my fascination with architecture transcends mere aesthetic appreciation; it is rooted in the profound ability of architectural forms to encapsulate history, culture, and innovation within their structures. To me, architecture is a tangible manifestation of human creativity and ingenuityâ€”a discipline that harmoniously blends art and science to create environments that influence our emotions, behaviors, and daily lives. The process of envisioning and bringing to life structures that could stand the test of time and become landmarks of human achievement is incredibly inspiring.
